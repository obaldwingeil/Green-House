Find a ladybug! - Place it on a flower to make the flower grow faster 
A ladybug will appear in a random spot around the fountain every 10 seconds, once a ladybug appears, the farmer will go catch it and bring it to the closest flower. 
Each flower has three stages, when placed, the ladybug moves the flower to its next stage, if it is full grown, the farmer will harvest it. 

End Screen - Once the farmer has collected a total of ten plants, he will exit the greenhouse and make a bouquet for the player :)
